# Josica Ganesamurthy Portfolio

## Technologies Used: Jekyll, Skeleton.css

* This project is a Jekyll site, which is a lightweight framework for building static sites. [Jekyll documentation is here.](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* To make a copy of this project and to deploy it live, you'll need a [Github account](https://github.com/join), and you'll need to have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in your development environment. [Git resources are here.](http://stackforyourself.com/comp-sci/2016/05/01/github/)
* Although this Jekyll site builds its pages in partial pieces, those pieces are still made out of [HTML](http://stackforyourself.com/front-end/2016/06/01/front-end-part-1-html-css-dom/).
* Styling is done with [CSS](http://stackforyourself.com/front-end/2016/06/01/front-end-part-1-html-css-dom/), and the main stylesheet is `assets/stylesheets/main.css`.
* [JavaScript](http://stackforyourself.com/front-end/2016/06/01/javascript-uncategorized/) is also involved in this project, but only to manage hiding and showing the main navbar mobile menu icon.
* Jekyll uses [liquid](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/basics), a templating language developed by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). Check out `_layouts/post.html` to start to see how liquid works.

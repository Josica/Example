  <center><h4>Hello, I'm Josica Ganesamurthy.</h4></center>
  <!-- <center><h4>வணக்கம், என் பெயர் ஜொசிக்கா.</h4></center>  -->
<p>
I'm a full stack web developer, born & raised in New York City. I'm a City University of New York, College of Staten Island grad with a degree in Computer Science.
Since I graduated in June 2016, I have enrolled at Dev Bootcamp to learn web development, and have recently graduated in March 2017.
I am currently looking for opportunities to build full-stack solutions. In my free time I enjoy dancing, cooking vegetarian food, and creating gifs!
Have a look at some of my projects.
